Pretty old code, originally developed for a client, never got much love, cause its been totally overdeveloped.
Only changes done so far are a few cosmetic updates and replacing the hardcoded German messages with possible i18n stuff. Aside of that, you're getting the original source code in all its .. uh .. glory ^_^
